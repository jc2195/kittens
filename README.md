# Kittens API
The goal of this project was to create a simple Kittens app on Rails, and include a basic API, where either all kittens, or a specific kitten, can be requested.

The project was completed as part of The Odin Project - Ruby On Rails - APIS, which can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis?ref=lnav
